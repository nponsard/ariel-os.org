Hurray! We just published our first 0.1 release, with which we already enable building portable multi-core applications on Cortex-M, RISC-V and ESP32 devices, using different link-layer and application layer networking protocols, including out-of-the-box secure communication. Our [Github](https://ariel-os.org/) has all the links to examples, manual and API docs. Check out the code of our [initial release](https://github.com/ariel-os/ariel-os/releases/tag/v0.1.0).
